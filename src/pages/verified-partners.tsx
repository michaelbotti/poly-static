            A "Verified Partner" must follow these Best Practices:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              If a $handle is used to resolve an address:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The $handle NFT image must be displayed to the user to verify
                  it resolved as expected, before a transaction is submitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't use "autocomplete" to resolve a $handle. This often
                  resolves to incorrect handles if the user doesn't type fast
                  enough. Wait for a user submit action like typing "Enter" or
                  click a submit button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Perform a double-check before transaction submission, just to
                  ensure the user didn't type something after $handle resolution
                  already took place. Check that the resolution still matches.
                  If not, send an error back to the user.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              If a $handle NFT image is used as a wallet avatar, the partner
              must display the $handle that has the "default" flag in the
              metadata. If more than one $handle has a default flag, the one
              with the most recent timestamp will be used.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
