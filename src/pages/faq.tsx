                    Cryptocurrencies are cryptographically guaranteed ledgers.
                    That means that every time you want to receive crypto, you
                    need to know your wallet address as well as the sender's.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Normally this wouldn't be a big deal â€” except that in
                    crypto, addresses are encrypted key pairs, and on Cardano
                    they look like this:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <code>addr1q9wt6pdnl3v4m29...qtmyxyqamvv22sv7pj7q</code>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's not very pretty, nor or easy to remember. Once you
                    own an @ADA Handle NFT, you can use our platform to send and
                    receive crypto purely by using your address.
                  </p>

                    Yes and no. Currently, the NFT you receive after purchasing
                    guarantees ownership of your @handle, lets you change the
                    associated address trustlessly, and allows you to sell that
                    ownership to anyone else.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the interface to interpret this is a centralized
                    one that we maintain. We have a financial incentive to
                    interpret an accurate send addresses so that customers keep
                    purchasing NFTs and using our platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, we maintain a centralized pay-to-use API
                    service to allow wallet and web developers to integrate @ADA
                    Handle into their app, further incentivizing operational
                    integrity.

                  <p>
                    Additionally, and especially in the cases of sending large

                    There will be 3 NFT pre-sale phases, ending in permanent
                    availability. This will allow us to adequately handle demand
                    and scale our resources, and also catch any bugs along the
                    way.
                  </p>
                  <p>The 3 phases are:</p>
